# Hello!

I'm Megha, an IT student with lots of cool projects to share. I'm really into using data to make smart decisions and love finding ways to help the environment too. When I'm not into dirty data, you'll catch me getting my hands dirty in the garden, whipping up delicious meals in the kitchen, or keeping things neat and tidy. Check out my projects to see what I've been up to! Thanks for stopping by!
